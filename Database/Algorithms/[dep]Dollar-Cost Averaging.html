<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    A strategy for spreading out asset purchases over time to mitigate volatility and lower average entry costs during market downtrends.
</p>

<h4>Entry Conditions (AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI is below 50.</li>
    <li>Current price is below the 50-period MA.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exit Conditions (Profit Indicator):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Exit when the price has doubled from the initial purchase level.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose and Best Use Case:</h4>
<p>
    DCA is excellent for long-term investors who wish to build positions gradually, avoiding the pitfalls of lump-sum purchases that might occur just before further price drops. This strategy helps reduce the emotional strain of entering at the wrong time by averaging down the entry price during bear markets.
</p>
<p>
    For new traders, understanding that DCA is less about timing the market and more about participating consistently is key. It is best used when there is a general belief in the long-term value of an asset and when market sentiment is bearish but stabilizing. Exiting when the asset has doubled allows for significant profit realization without being overly aggressive.
</p>

<h4>Best Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    A major index ETF drops steadily over three months, allowing the trader to buy incrementally at increasingly lower prices. When the market rebounds over the next year, the trader exits after the price doubles, resulting in significant profits.
</p>

<h4>Worst Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    The trader begins a DCA strategy during what appears to be a temporary dip, but the market enters a prolonged bearish period, causing further declines and locking up capital without a clear exit opportunity for months.
