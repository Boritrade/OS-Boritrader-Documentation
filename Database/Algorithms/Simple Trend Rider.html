<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    This strategy aims to participate in strong uptrends by entering when RSI shows significant bullish momentum and exiting when gains are locked or momentum fades.
</p>

<h4>Entry Conditions (AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI is above 70 on the 4-hour chart.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exit Conditions (Profit or Stop-Loss Indicator, OR):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Price increases by 6% from entry (Profit Indicator).</li>
    <li>RSI falls below 55 (Stop-Loss Indicator).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose and Best Use Case:</h4>
<p>
    The Simple Trend Ride Strategy is most effective for trending markets with sustained bullish momentum. This approach is straightforward and reduces the cognitive load for traders who prefer to rely on defined signals. The focus on RSI levels ensures that entries are only triggered when the market shows robust buying interest.
</p>
<p>
    New traders should understand that this strategy is not suitable for range-bound markets as it may lead to false positives when RSI hits high levels without real upward follow-through. Utilizing this strategy during known bullish periods or following major news events that spur market enthusiasm is ideal for maximizing potential gains.
</p>

<h4>Best Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    A commodity enters a strong uptrend, driven by supply disruptions, pushing the RSI to 75. The trader enters a position and, within a week, the price increases by 10%, allowing the trader to secure profits before momentum weakens.
</p>

<h4>Worst Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    The RSI hits 72, indicating momentum, and the trader enters a position. However, unforeseen market news causes the price to reverse, dropping below the initial entry level before the 6% profit target is met, resulting in a forced exit with minimal gains or a slight loss.
