<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    A long-term strategy that aims to buy in oversold conditions and exit when the market shows overbought signs, using RSI as the main indicator.
</p>

<h4>Entry Conditions (AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI is below 35.</li>
    <li>The current price is below the MA100.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exit Conditions (Profit Indicator):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI exceeds 65.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose and Best Use Case:</h4>
<p>
    This strategy is highly effective for traders looking for entry opportunities when assets are undervalued. It thrives in trending markets that exhibit distinct cycles of overbought and oversold conditions. The best use case is when traders aim to capture prolonged upward momentum that follows a period of price consolidation or correction.
</p>
<p>
    For new traders, it's essential to understand that while RSI below 35 signals potential undervaluation, combining this strategy with volume analysis or fundamental news can provide an extra layer of confidence before committing to an entry. Exiting when the RSI is above 65 ensures that profits are realized during moments of peak interest.
</p>

<h4>Best Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    An equity index experiences a temporary dip, with RSI falling to 30. The price is well below the MA100. The trader enters a position and holds it as the market recovers over the next month, with RSI reaching 70, leading to a significant gain.
</p>

<h4>Worst Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    A stock in a prolonged downtrend shows an RSI of 33 and is below the MA100. The trader buys, expecting a bounce. However, negative economic news pushes the stock further down, resulting in continued losses without any significant RSI recovery.
