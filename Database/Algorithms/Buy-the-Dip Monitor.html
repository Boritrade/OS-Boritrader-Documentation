<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This strategy seeks to identify oversold conditions in the market and potential reversals. It uses RSI and EMA crossovers as confirmation for entries and exits.</p>

<h4>Entry Conditions (AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI is below 40 and decreases by at least 3 points compared to the previous reading.</li>
    <li>EMA100 is above EMA50.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exit Conditions (Profit Indicator AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI rises above 65.</li>
    <li>EMA50 crosses above EMA100.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose and Best Use Case:</h4>
<p>
    This strategy is best suited for traders who want to buy low during corrections or market pullbacks. This strategy works well when the market shows signs of temporary exhaustion, leading to a reversal or at least a relief rally. However, new traders must be aware that catching falling prices can be risky, especially in strong downtrends. It is recommended to use this strategy alongside broader market analysis and confirm that the asset is reaching a historical support level or displaying divergence in other technical indicators. Patience is key; wait for all entry signals to align before activating a trade.
</p>

<h4>Best Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    A cryptocurrency experiences a sharp correction, with RSI dropping to 35. After a few hours, EMA100 is found above EMA50, signaling stability. The price bounces back, leading to a rally of 15% over the next few days, and the trader exits when RSI reaches 70.
</p>

<h4>Worst Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    The market is in a strong downtrend, and although RSI dips below 40 and the trader enters based on the strategy, the price continues to fall as selling pressure intensifies. The trade results in a loss as the anticipated reversal fails to materialize.
