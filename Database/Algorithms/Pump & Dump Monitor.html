<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    This strategy targets rapid price surges and declines by leveraging moving averages, volume spikes, and RSI levels to identify pumps and potential dumps.
</p>

<h4>Entry Conditions (AND):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Current price is above MA9.</li>
    <li>MA9 is above MA100.</li>
    <li>Significant volume change (&gt;100% increase from the previous period).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exit Conditions (Profit or Stop-Loss Indicator, OR):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>RSI falls below 50 (Stop-Loss Indicator).</li>
    <li>RSI exceeds 77 (Profit Indicator).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose and Best Use Case:</h4>
<p>
    The Pump and Dump Strategy is tailored for traders who want to capitalize on sudden market excitement, often observed in crypto or smaller-cap stocks. It is most effective when applied to assets known for high volatility and trading volumes that can spike sharply.
</p>
<p>
    New traders should approach this strategy cautiously, as price pumps are often short-lived and can reverse abruptly. The key to success is rapid execution and awareness of potential risks. This strategy works best when paired with real-time monitoring and quick decision-making to avoid getting caught in post-pump price declines.
</p>

<h4>Best Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    A small-cap cryptocurrency announces a major partnership, resulting in a sudden 50% price increase accompanied by high volume. The trader enters and exits quickly as RSI hits 77, locking in gains before the price reverts.
</p>

<h4>Worst Case Example:</h4>
<p>
    The trader enters a position during a sudden volume spike and price surge. Before an exit can be made, the price drops just as fast due to profit-taking or negative news, resulting in a loss or break-even outcome.
